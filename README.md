# Machine-Learning-Recognising-Hand-Written-Digits
The data set contains images of hand-written digits: 10 classes where each class refers to a digit.
In this project, by using a set of ML algorithms, a computational intelligence approach is applied to recognize the hand-written digits on images. The given dataset was utilised for training and testing the Logistic Regression,GradientBoosting Classification, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classification, ML algorithms. The classification analysis of this dataset followed the steps of data splitting, preprocessing, Fitting the classification models, and evaluation. The resultant outcome revealed that RandomForest Classification achieved highest accuracy score.
